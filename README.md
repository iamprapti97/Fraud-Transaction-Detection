# Fraud-Transaction-Detection
Overview
Welcome to our Fraud Transaction Detection System! This powerful system is designed to identify and prevent fraudulent transactions within a financial environment. By leveraging advanced algorithms and machine learning techniques, we aim to ensure the security and integrity of financial transactions, providing peace of mind to both customers and businesses.

Key Features
1. Real-time Monitoring
Our system offers real-time monitoring of transactions as they occur. This instantaneous analysis allows for quick identification of potential fraud, enabling timely intervention to prevent any unauthorized activities.

2. Machine Learning Models
The core of our Fraud Transaction Detection System lies in its sophisticated machine learning models. These models are trained on historical transaction data to recognize patterns associated with fraudulent behavior. As new transactions occur, the system evaluates them against these learned patterns to determine the likelihood of fraud.

3. Anomaly Detection
The system employs anomaly detection techniques to identify transactions that deviate from regular patterns. Unusual transaction amounts, unusual locations, or irregular spending patterns trigger alerts for further investigation.

4. Behavior Analysis
By analyzing the typical behavior of account holders, the system establishes a baseline for normal activities. Any deviations from this baseline, such as sudden large transactions or transactions in atypical locations, raise flags for potential fraudulent activity.

5. Rule-based Filters
In addition to machine learning models, the system incorporates rule-based filters to catch known fraud patterns. These rules act as an additional layer of defense, helping to identify and block transactions that match predefined criteria associated with fraud.
